#Day15 of My Python Learning Journey – Strings in Python

Today, I practiced one of the most commonly used data types in any programming language – **Strings**.

Strings are used to store text data, and Python gives us powerful tools to manipulate and work with them efficiently.

🔹 **Basic String Operations I Covered**:

✔️ Create and print a string
✔️ Find the length using `len()`
✔️ Access the first and last character using indexing
✔️ Convert the string to uppercase and lowercase
✔️ Check if a word is present using `in` keyword
✔️ Concatenate two strings using `+`

These simple but powerful operations form the base of working with text in any real-world Python project — whether it's data processing, web development, or automation.

💡 **Takeaway**: Understanding string manipulation is essential in Python. It's everywhere — from user input to file handling and even in backend logic!
